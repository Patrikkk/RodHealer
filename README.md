# RodHealer
Heals players when using Rod of discord

Getting tired of killing yourself all the time, when you feel like spamming your Rod of Discord? Well, this is your solution!

This plugin will heal you whenever you use Rod of Discord with Chaos State buff active, and only as much damage as you receive (to prevent abuse of healing more than you should).


To use the healing effect, your group requires the rodhealer.ignoredamage permission.
